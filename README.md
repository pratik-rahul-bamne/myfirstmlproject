Project Title: Teachable Machine: Identify you are with mic or not.

Description:
This project leverages Google's Teachable Machine to create a custom machine learning model for Identify you are with mic or not. Without requiring extensive coding knowledge, this tool enables anyone to train a model using a simple web interface.

Key Features:

No-Code Machine Learning: Utilizing Teachable Machine's intuitive interface to train models without writing complex code.
Custom Model Training: Creating personalized models tailored to specific use cases and datasets.
Real-time Inference: Implementing real-time predictions using the trained model.
Export and Integration: Exporting the model in various formats for integration into web applications, mobile apps, and other projects.
How to Use:



Data Collection: The project includes a dataset of data type, e.g., images, audio clip are used to train the model.
Model Architecture: The underlying model architecture, likely a neural network, is automatically generated by Teachable Machine.
Limitations: While Teachable Machine is a powerful tool, it may have limitations in terms of model complexity and customization options.
Ethical Considerations: Ensure responsible use of the model, considering potential biases and unintended consequences.
By sharing this project on GitHub, you can contribute to the open-source community, inspire others, and showcase your creativity in leveraging AI and machine learning.
